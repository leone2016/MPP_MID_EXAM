# Shipment Tracking System

The system currently allows any type of Shipment to be created.  
**Your task is to modify the code so that only three shipment types (Standard, Express, Overnight) are possible in the future.**
No other shipment types should be permitted, now or later.

- Each shipment type should have its own data fields and tracking logic.
- Only the allowed shipment types should be processed in `ShipmentTracker`.

Your repository includes:
- Shipment.java
- StandardShipment.java
- ExpressShipment.java
- OvernightShipment.java
- ShipmentTracker.java

**You may refactor or restructure as needed, but you must preserve the three allowed shipment types and prevent the creation of any new ones.**
